## General
Arclight is an ecosystem intended to help developers in creating new C++ projects quickly without having to setup a common codebase everytime.
It offers a wide range of features, ranging from basic utilities over image manipulation up to 3D rendering.

Additionally, all code is written in C++20 by making heavy use of new concepts introduced in later C++ standards.
No code cruft, no old libraries from over 20 years, no license confusion: Arclight unifies all aspects of application development into one toolbox.

The code is not aimed towards a particular audience; Instead, everyone can write applications with it, no matter your level of profession or skill.
And if you once decide to look how a particular feature is implemented, go ahead! Everything was written to be as clear as possible without requiring too much prior knowledge on the user's side.

### So, why would you want to use Arclight?

Because development has never been that simple. We aim at maximum flexibility, user experience and performance so that you can get exactly what you want.

*Note that Arclight is under heavy development right now.* Interfaces might drastically change on active branches.
Due to that, most of the code is yet to be documented in the near future. If you need stability and consistency, we recommend waiting until the first full release.

## Features
The following features have been fully implemented:
- OpenGL 3D rendering backend GLE
