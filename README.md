# Arclight Engine
High-performance and flexible game engine

## General
Writing games is a hard task and requires a lot of organization, flexibility and knowledge.
To ease developers in creating a game, game engines are often utilized to serve as a backend for the game.
That way, developers don't need to delve into low-level systems.

Several popular game engines exist as of now though there are several catches: Some contain mostly outdated or obsolete code, others may devide to overtake too many parts of the development process.
This is exactly what the Arclight Engine is intended for. It exposes an interface that allows a great deal of flexibility while maintaining a high grade of performance and without aquiring strong ownership of the game itself.

## Features
Planned features are the following:
- Lossless callback-driven window and input interface
- Audio Engine powered by FMOD for input/output streams
- Powerful Rendering Engine (GLE) with OpenGL backend and pipeline abstraction
- Hybrid game logic engine with a hierarchy-based component system
- Networking support for multiplayer games
- Fast and precise physics with a high grade of extensibility/flexibility
- Lua integration and JIT interoperability to offer easy scripting support
- Caching resource API
- Collection of util functions and classes

## Progress
As of now, progress is published in branch engine-base. 
You can check out progress on what has already been done, what is in progress right now and what still needs to be done.

## Support
If you want to support this project, feel free to donate as soon as donation is set up.

If you want to join out team, contact me through overblade.dev@gmail.com. Please note that this is a very advanced project and requires at least 3 years of knowledge in C++ and at least *some* knowledge in game engine design and game development. I cannot give any guarantees whether your application will be successful or not.
